#Â Static Server w/ Jade (3/8)

Create an Express.js app with a home page rendered by the Jade template engine.

The home page should respond to `/home`

The view should show the current date using `new Date.toDateString()`.

We use `toDateString() to simply return the date in a human-readable format
without the time.
