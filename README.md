# CSS w/ Express (5/8)

HTML without styles is boring so this exercise will teach you how to use Stylus with Express on the fly.

Style the HTML from the "STATIC" exercise using Stylus middleware.
[Stylus](https://github.com/stylus/stylus) generates `.css` files on-the-fly from `.styl` files.

Your solution should listen on the port supplied by `process.argv[2]` for
GET requests, one of which will be for `main.css`, which should be
automatically generated by your Stylus middleware. `index.html` and `main.styl`can be found in `process.argv[3]` (they are in the same directory).

You could also create your own folder and use these, if you like:

The `main.styl` file:

    p
      color red

The `index.html` file:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>expressworks</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>I am red!</p>
      </body>
    </html>
